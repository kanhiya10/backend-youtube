// "multer".diskStorage: This function creates a storage configuration for storing uploaded files on disk.

// "destination": This function specifies where the uploaded files should be stored. In this case, files will be saved to the ./public/temp directory. The cb function (callback) is called with 
// null for errors and the path to the destination directory.

// "filename": This function specifies the name of the file when itâ€™s saved. Here, it uses the original file name (file.originalname). Again, cb is called with null for errors and the desired filename.



// "multer({ storage })": This creates an instance of the multer middleware with the specified storage configuration. The upload constant can be used as middleware in your Express 
// routes to handle file uploads.
